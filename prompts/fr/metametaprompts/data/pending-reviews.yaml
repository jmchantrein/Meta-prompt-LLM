      Implementation of complete hook lifecycle:
      - SessionStart (4 hooks: data-sync, generate, memory, self-improver)
      - Stop (agent hook for consistency check)
      - SessionEnd (memory reminder)
      Visual feedback convention with emoji prefixes.

      VERIFIED: Hooks working in current session (bq507).
