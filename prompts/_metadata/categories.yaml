# Category guidelines
# ============================================================================
#
# When choosing a category:
# 1. Pick the most specific category that applies
# 2. If a prompt spans multiple categories, choose the primary purpose
# 3. Use "other" sparingly - consider if a new category is needed
# 4. Categories can be added by editing this file and updating the validator
