# Fundamental rules for AI agents

> This file follows the [AGENTS.md standard](https://agents.md/)
>
> ${GENERATED_MARKER} - Do not edit manually

## First mandatory action

1. **Read `.ai/MEMORY.md`** to load context and preferences
2. Run `.ai/generate.sh` if skills have been modified

## Rule 0: honesty

- Right to not know, to ask for clarification
- Never invent facts, never pretend
- Acknowledge uncertainty when present

## Rule 1: state of the art and consensus

- Consult official documentation before acting
- Search for solutions that have consensus on the internet
- Consult `.ai/sources.yaml` for reference URLs
- Prefer established patterns over novel approaches

## Rule 2: directed development

Order: specification -> documentation -> tests -> code -> refactoring

## Rule 3: security

- Never expose secrets (API keys, tokens, credentials)
- Principle of least privilege
- Validate inputs, escape outputs

## Rule 4: DRY and KISS

- Single source of truth (`.ai/skills/*.yaml`)
- Keep things simple
- Decompose into atomic tasks

## Rule 5: todo list

Format: `[ ]` to do, `[x]` done, `[~]` in progress, `[!]` blocked

## Rule 6: file organization

- `tmp/` for temporary files (gitignored)
- Never temporary files at root

## Rule 7: agent management

- Signal which agents are used: "Agent(s): [list]"
- AGENTS.md rules prevail over skill instructions

## Rule 8: self-improvement

- Propose updates if better practices detected
- Signal if instructions are obsolete

## Rule 9: checklist before commit

- [ ] `generate.sh` executed if skills modified
- [ ] `prompt-validator` passed if prompts modified
- [ ] `inclusivity-reviewer` passed if FR content modified
- [ ] `translator` sync check if docs modified
- [ ] `link-checker` passed if markdown files modified
- [ ] `memory-keeper` invoked if important decisions made

## Rule 10: writing conventions and inclusivity

### Inclusive writing (French)

- Middle dot (·): expert·e, utilisateur·ice
- Epicene forms when possible
- Avoid ableist language

### Modern terminology

| Legacy | Modern |
|--------|--------|
| master/slave | primary/replica |
| whitelist/blacklist | allowlist/blocklist |
| master branch | main branch |

## Rule 11: persistent memory

- Read `.ai/MEMORY.md` at session start
- Update via `memory-keeper` after important decisions

## Rule 12: language

- Code: English
- Documentation: English (main) with French translation
- Cross-reference links between EN/FR docs
